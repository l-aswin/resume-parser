# Resume Parser
A Resume Parser using NER and SpaCy is an AI-powered tool that extracts key information from resumes using Named Entity Recognition (NER). 
SpaCy, a popular NLP library, identifies relevant entities such as names, contact details, education, skills, and work experience.
The parser processes resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX) and converts unstructured text into structured data, simplifying tasks like recruitment and applicant tracking.
